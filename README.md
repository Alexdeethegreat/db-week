## Data Analytics Week at the AWS Loft

Data Analytics Week at the AWS Loft is an opportunity to learn about Amazonâ€™s broad and deep family of managed database services. These services provide easy, scalable, reliable, and cost-effective ways to manage your data in the cloud.

## Labs

[Managed Database Basics](https://github.com/wrbaldwin/db-week/blob/master/Labs/managed-database-basics.md) - In this lab you will learn, how to create an EC2 instance for use as a SQL client that connects to an RDS/MySQL instance. Next, you will create a database, load a public Landsat dataset into it, and query your database using SQL. Finally, you will learn how to use the RDS console including stopping, starting, monitoring, snapshots and other RDS features.

[Upgrading and Consolidating MySQL](https://github.com/wrbaldwin/db-week/blob/master/Labs/upgrading-and-consolidating-mySQL) - Add a description here.

[A Simple Database Migration](https://github.com/wrbaldwin/db-week/blob/master/Labs/a-simple-database-migration) - This workshop is a hands-on journey for existing Oracle DBAs moving to Aurora PostgreSQL. Attendees will deploy an instance of Aurora PostgreSQL, migrate and generate a test workload on PostgreSQL, and manually monitor the database to understand the workload. They will review a few ways to track queries and their execution plans, and what can be done to optimize the queries. Attendees will also learn how to do the same on Aurora PostgreSQL using Performance Insights for query analysis and tuning.

[Comparing Redis with Relational](https://github.com/wrbaldwin/db-week/blob/master/Labs/comparing-redis-with-relational) - In this lab you create an EC2 instance for use as a SQL and Redis client. Next, you will create an RDS instance using MySQL, connect your SQL client instance to your RDS instance. Then you will create a database and load a public landsat dataset into it and query your database using SQL. Finally, you will create an ElastiCache for Redis cluster, connect your Redis client instance to your ElastiCache cluster, and query your ElastiCache cluster using Redis commands.
